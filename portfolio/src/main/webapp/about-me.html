        <div class="about-main-content">

            <p><b>Hello!</b> My name is Claudia Monge Torres. Currently and at the moment, I am a full-time
                computer science student. <br>
                I originated in the town of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Humacao,+Puerto+Rico/@22.620792,-56.4098252,3.09z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8c04a898d87093e3:0xceb5e85b1704d482!8m2!3d18.1551337!4d-65.8203943">Humacao,
                    Puerto Rico</a> and continued my studies in Bayamón, where I
                have been able to have my beginning in university life being a by present in clubs and associations inluding
                "Women in Cybersecurity - Bayamón Chaper" and the "Computer Science Student Association". These
                experiences disciplined me and made me know more about my passions within programming. <br>
                One topic that I am passionate about is improving the local economy and the growth of small businesses in Puerto Rico. Given
                this, I started a project called 'De la Casa' with some of my friends in the field of technology to
                ideate the development of a platform that focuses on this sector of the Puerto Rican economy and give them the spotlight 
                they deserve. I have used all these experiences to believe and discover who I really am, to learn and unlearn
                so that in
                the near future I can positively impact the community. <br>
                Now that I'm here in Google's Software Product Sprint, I hope to keep growing and learning from such
                experienced professionals.
            </p>

            <h2>Who I am:</h2>
            <h4>How I started</h4>
            <p class="about-info"> I have always been very curious, even as a kid, about technology. I was able to learn how to
                use the computer at an early age because I spenta great amount of time at my mom's office supply store.
                But the key experience that fueled my passion for technology was participating in a coding camp before
                entering high school. In this camp they taught us the introduction to the fundamentals of programming
                and
                gave us a preview of startups that where beggining to form in Puerto Rico. Having the opportunity to
                meet a large number of people
                who spoke so passionately about their projects or their work and the great experience that I had
                together were key to deciding on the career that I am currently in.</p>

            <br>

            <h4>How I envision the future</h4>
            <p class="about-info"> From here to the future I want to be able to experiment in different areas of computer science and choose some
                 to continue my studies. I envision myself during this time being a voice for girls in tech. I want to do a 
                 mentoring program in order to encourage the participation of more girls in the STEM area. In this way, it could
                 help to close the gender gap in these areas. As I mentioned earlier, I would like to be able to carry out the project 
                 that seeks to improve the local economy and the growth of small businesses in Puerto Rico. This is, since a large 
                 part of the Puerto Rican economy falls on small and local businesses. On top of that, I want to be part of the 
                 people who empower and inspire other women to be part of the movement to increase the representation of women in 
                 STEM. Since there is already knowledge about the gender disparity in STEM, I would like to come up with 
                 an initiative or be part of one as this would give girls and women opportunities in the field beforehand.</p>

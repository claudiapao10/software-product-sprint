                    <p>Hi everyone! Once again, thank you for visiting my personal portfolio.
                        Being part of SPS already excites me a lot, but knowing that such experienced people will be
                        able to help along the way as I put hard work into my future projects motivates me as well. I am
                        thrilled to learn as much as I can, grow as a person, and polish the things that I already
                        know (because, we never really stop learning!).
                    </p>
                    <p><b>PS:</b> As you scroll down, you'll be seeing all of my SPS experiences!</p>
                    <p>- <i>Claudia</i></p>

                        <p class="card-text"> Yesterday was the SPS kickoff #11 and the only word that comes to mind
                            after it, is "wow". I am really excited to learn and grow as a person in this program since
                            it has so much to offer. One of the many things I enjoyed from yesterday's kickoff was the
                            "Gif scavenger
                            hunt" since everyone in the call had a chance to bond over similar interests. As of today I
                            can confirm that I will make the most of this SPS experience! </p>
